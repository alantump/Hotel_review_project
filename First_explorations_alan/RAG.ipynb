Positive Guest Review: On arrival we were warmly welcomed and made to feel very much at home by our host Mr. Manolis. He was kind enough to give us details about things to do things to see and nearby grocery stores from where to buy local produce and even made phone calls for us to the bus station for bus timings. Being in his advanced years he also had quite a few stories to share about the past of Chania Crete and the property itself which is many centuries old. The room was cozy and very clean even though it was off season when we visited. Interiors are tastefully done. There is a little balcony which opens over a street in with small shops selling all kinds of souvenirs. It also offers views to the sea from one side. Overall lovely experience!. Hotel: 11City Rooms.

I loved the fair size balcony overlooking the back of the hotel with garden view. The bed and lighting were perfect. The place was spotless. The fridge and complimentary drink and nibbles were very much welcomed. I must mention the kindness and perseverance of the owner. I had issues with my phone and was unable to retrieve my Airline Boarding Pass (I was flying home the following morning). He went out of his way to try and help took me to see various people including his son-in-law ... and ultimately sent me in the right direction to get my phone unlocked first thing the following day. The owner was a gentleman and genuinely lovely man who obviously takes much pride in his hotel and such good care of his guests. I would wholeheartedly recommend staying a 11 City Rooms and will be sure to do so myself if I ever visit Chania again.. Hotel: 11City Rooms. Negative Guest Review: The Small Room with Balcony is exactly that. It was ideal for a solo traveller for one or two nights but would struggle to accommodate more than one guest or travel case. The sink in the bathroom is tiny ... too small to wash your face or have a shave. However the photos clearly show this so can’t really complain.\\n\\nHotel: 11City Rooms.

I was 1-2 minutes walking from my car. •It’s also 1-2 minutes walking from Harbour and on the way has many touristy restaurants/bars/boutiques. •Very quiet in the room despite the street noise down below! It’s due to the building being old and made of stone. (The room is modern! Just has stone foundation) It stays cool during the hot days but also stays quiet inside! If it did get louder than I liked however they did say there were shutters I could close. But I didn’t need to. •I loved that there was water in the fridge and they also gave a gift of cinnamon-honey Raki. Delicious. •Very hospitable hosts I was able to store my luggage after my check out until I had to leave Chania.. Hotel: 11City Rooms. Negative Guest Review: The TV was small and mainly had 1.000 Arabic channels. The other couple hundred channels were French and German. There were 2 English news channels.

Bathroom was tiny and the sink difficult to actually lean over as it is recessed into an alcove a lot narrower than my shoulders.

The apartment complex is very modern, new and very clean. Since we had a barrier-free apartment on the ground floor, the bathroom was very large. The bed was super comfortable. The roof garden of the complex is fantastically beautiful, from which you can look out over the city and where breakfast is also served. Communication was via WhatsApp, which made it very easy for us. The taxi to the airport was also ordered for us and arrived on time to the minute. There is a very good Greek restaurant nearby, Vardis Taverna, away from the tourist crowds.. Hotel: 7Rizes Luxury Living. Negative Guest Review: The room was very small and there were no places to put suitcases. There was no closet, just drawers under the bed and on the bedside table. A few more hooks in the bathroom would have been useful. It's fine for one or two nights on the way to the airport, but we wouldn't stay here for longer. Especially since the airport is so close that you can hear the planes flying right over the house.\\n\\nHotel: 7Rizes Luxury Living.

Positive Guest Review: The location of the hotel is very central I can say the heart of Rethymno right in the middle. We have reached the city by bus from Chania and the bus station is distanced 15 minutes flat walking or max 5 min with taxi. The beach is 3 minutes walking but it depends where you want to go so I would recommend to go a little bit further from the marine because the water is cleaner. Due to central location you have many restaurants groceries pharmacies and bakeries close to you max 5 min distance. Even though is centrally located the hotel is located on a very quiet street so you don't have to worry if you have the room on the street because I believe the ones with the garden view are quiet for sure. The room was spacious for two people and it had enough space to live function and enjoy. What is most important we had balcony with normal size where we could put our towels and also enjoy our time. It is obvious from the pictures that the hotel is not renovated for quite some time and the furniture is not the newest but is comfortable and well kept so this takes me to my next point cleanliness. Cleanliness - the room was clean cleaned daily so the hygiene was on high level. We didn't swim in the pool but we checked it. There is a small bar and sunbeds with towels from the hotel and is clean. From up there you can seethe city of Rethymno. The breakfast was classic eggs cheese ham vegetables feta variety of bread coffee some sweet cakes cereals and fruits. It was nothing special but it was fresh and tasty. The stuff - this was the best part. Very friendly nice and well organized people. From the first day when we were welcomed we felt very good with the receptionist housekeepers and the kitchen stuff.

Natasa particularly gave us so many great food recommendations and hooked us up with car hire and taxis.. Hotel: Aisha Hotel. Negative Guest Review: When booking the Tsatmas room we liked that it had a ‘shared terrace’. The room’s only windows open out onto the terrace (meaning beautiful views). But because all guests can use the terrace during breakfast (which isn’t made clear) and it’s a popular place to have a cigarette it meant that we had to sleep with the curtains pulled and the windows shut (wafting smoke aside it’s a bit odd to have randomers eating outside the windows when you’re waking up). But the air conditioning is top notch so we just used that! Also the bass from the club nearby does come through the floor and is open until 5am (never kept us up but you can feel it).

The only warm option is eggs though so don’t expect a full English. The location couldn’t be better if you want to be in the centre of things and have a great view of the harbour. The check in/ check out experience couldn’t have been better. We arrived after reception closed but had been given access codes and even a video so the process was painless.

Natasa was extremely helpful with everything and we couldn’t have asked for better.. Hotel: Aisha Hotel. Negative Guest Review: All the rooms are on the first floor only accessible by a 21 step staircase which is quite steep. Older couples ( like us) could find this an issue. The property has a nice terrace with views to the lighthouse unfortunately unless your room opens out onto the terrace this is only accessible via a steep stone staircase through the reception area. As reception closes at 4pm this means there is no access after this time. We found it unusual for reception in such a high class establishment to only be open 9 - 4. Also quite quirky that (from our room anyway) you have to go out into the street and into next door for breakfast/ reception. The ambience of the rooms is exceptional however a little impractical with regards to storage and also water running onto the bathroom floor from the shower.. We had an issue also with noise/vibration from the nightclubs below which continued until 4am. Earplugs were provided but I found them ineffective. We chose this hotel because of its high rating and positive comments with hindsight we should also have considered the negatives. If you can take all of the above in your stride then there is no better place to stay in Chania.'),\n",

We used one bottle of water from the minibar (note that it was reasonably surprising to not have any free-of-charge water in a 4 stars hotel) which we actually replaced as we used the minibar fridge to cool bottles we bought during our 4 days stay. The front desk person called her room staff during the checkout to check our minibar consumption she got confirmation that bottle was replaced. She claimed this was not possible to do so. Fundamentally I would have accepted without any personal concern if all this situation would have been managed within a friendly exchange.

She offered suggestions for restaurants and stores and even made sure my room got fixed after it was messed up when I checked in. She has been one of the best receptionists I've encountered in all my travels in Europe (over a dozen work and business trips). In the room I liked the extra metal door on the outside balcony that kept both light and sound from getting in. Allowed me to not wake up when the streets were populated with celebrations and fireworks. I loved that the AC worked and was strong. I still had an extra fan but that made it extremely comfortable for me.. Hotel: Civitel Akali Hotel. Negative Guest Review: Breakfast. I didn't think any of the breakfast options were good. Even the juice tasted weird. Given the number of tourists and school personnel that come through here I think a more simple (or diverse) breakfast would be better.

G the owner (manager?) answered my request for help with parking my rental car and we communicated on WhatsApp too. Turns out I got lucky with a place one block up because one thing's for sure - parking is a bit of a challenge. Still in a worst-case situation there's plenty of parking around the Venetian Port area a 10-minute walk.

The wiring seemed suspicious to me, the kitchen had no controls and was managed through the oven controls. In short, we couldn't cook half of the things we bought.

Negative Guest Review: If we really have to point out a thing to improve - the sport equipment was a little damaged and it should be great to get some new.\\n\\nHotel: Alexander Mountain Resort. Positive Guest Review: This hotel is located in a very nice and quiet village in the mountains. The hotel appears to be a little on the large side compared to the village it's in but I was here in off season. Come here if you want to escape the busy nature of Chania Rethymno or Iraklio. Sure during the off season the staff hang out in the evening with some friends at the pool but if you have a question they will gladly help you. In general the hotel is great value for money. Also: Apsida tavern in the village is simply exquisite! This tavern alone is worth a trip to Gerakari!. Hotel: Alexander Mountain Resort. Negative Guest Review: I did miss the ubiquitous water melon at breakfast that would make this hotel perfect for me.

Greece has a great coffee culture it is a shame to serve this sour and thin drip coffee. I wish we would get a normal coffee like anywhere in Cafés on Crete. - We didn't get any introduction or onboarding for the hotel only the key.

We only had breakfast in the hotel it was plenty of choice in both hot & cold food in both sweet & savoury dishes. There was also plenty of hot & cold drinks. We didn’t eat in the restaurant but the food looked really good & the restaurant was always busy.. Hotel: Alexis Hotel. Negative Guest Review: We did feel it was rather strange that you had to queue up & wait to be given a tray containing a plate knife & fork before you could start choosing your food then asked to bring the tray back with your used dishesrather than collected from your tableit felt a bit like being back at school! The staff weren’t as welcoming as we thought they would be there was a lovely assistant at breakfast who was always happy & helpful but otherwise there seemed to be a frosty atmosphere around the hotel. The towels in the bedroom although changed every couple of days seemed past there sale by date & could do with replacing all together. The shower mat didn’t ever seem to be changed at the same time as the towels so we washed it ourselves. The hotel is situated at the top of a steep hill so has fantastic views of the bay & views of some lovely sunsets but unless you have a car or catch a taxi you have walk up a steep hill on the way back from the beach or after getting off the bus on the main road.\\n\\nHotel: Alexis Hotel.

Negative Guest Review: I came to Crete several times over the past 5 years and I love it. Therefore in this past 5 years I have never encountered such careless services as I did at the Alex hotel. It seems like the owner was changed recently as I am unable to explain the many positive reviews. The hotel is old: the beds furniture and doors are very used making noise and not closing properly. There is no sound isolation and every closing door in the hotel creates so much noise that you can barely sleep. The staff complain to customers about having too much work though nothing is really done. I booked a room with a sea view (for an additional fee) for my birthday. When I arrived it was the wrong room with a pool view instead. Instead of finding another option they told us the hotel was overbooked (though I only saw 5 people during my stay). The solution was found after 45 minutes of waiting. The room was very unfresh with old towels. Nothing was like the pictures - there was only general soap no shampoo. I had to ask at least 3 times to change the towels or clean the room. The hotel is in a very steep area and super uncomfortable to get to. To get to the nearest very ugly beach you have to walk through a very large overgrown field (though the view is stunning). No shopping is possible without avoiding the hills and the field. I am very disappointed with my experience and will obviously never come back. I really don't recommend you stay there as for the same (overpriced) money there are at least 3 great hotels in the area.\"),\n",

It is good to know that the hotel is located on the top of a very steep and long hill so you need to be in good physical condition to walk anywhere from the hotel. Personnel was a little hard to read some very forthcoming and nice and some were downright rude. To get clothes hangers they insisted to copy her driving license and then she received 3 hangers the next day. She had 2 in the room. When leaving I went to the hotel to help her with her luggage as we were sharing a taxi to the airport. My husband was waiting with our suitcases and down the steep hill in the heat as we lived elsewhere but nearby. The person manning the reception and ordered the taxi for my mother-in-law told the taxi there was no need to hurry as we were in good time for the flight and when I pointed out that he was waiting for us he laughed and said that is his choice so he can stand there and wait.

The room was spotless each day we came back to it after a day out. Theo (the owner) is a delight to speak to. We had a few laughs with him and the restaurant staff on more than one occasion. The view from our balcony was amazing across the sea and down towards Chania and probably the best bit of our stay at this hotel.. Hotel: Alexis Hotel. Negative Guest Review: Our room was small and had very limited wardrobe space to put our clothes away. The furniture was basic and in need of updating. The bed was comfortable but the mattresses were very hard after a few nights and we began to feel the lumps and bumps show through. The bathroom was tiny and again in need of updating. The rain shower was great and there was plenty of hot water available. We walked into the Venetian harbour and it took approximately 45 minutes so be prepared to either catch the bus or taxi if you have walking issues. We paid for half board but what we didn't know until the first night at the restaurant there is a allowance of 17 euros per person so we had to pay additional amounts ontop of the drinks bill.\\n\\nHotel: Alexis Hotel.

I highly recommend the restaurant for dinner! It is a quick walk to a beautiful series of beaches the balcony is quite large and the side sea view is beautiful. The curtains and balcony doors do a great job of keeping out the light if you are trying to sleep in.. Hotel: Alexis Hotel. Negative Guest Review: It is approximately a 30min walk to old town- not the hotel’s fault of course but if you don’t have a vehicle it’s a bit far to walk daily. It’s located in a more residential area and the neighbors have loud dogs and chickens. Not an issue if you are a heavy sleeper/ have ear plugs or noise cancelling headphones. Taxis to town only cost approx. €7 one way so not a deal breaker by any means. The deal breaker for me was the noise. It is a LOUD hotel- minimal if any soundproofing. The doors to the room are very loud when they close it’s jarring if you aren’t ready for it. They also require some force to close- I didn’t pull hard enough to close and when I returned from dinner my door was slightly ajar. You can hear people speaking in a normal voice all the way down the hall inside your room. The entire time I was there there were loud children in the lobby. I don’t know if they were guests or belonged to the hotel staff. Until 2300 they would be yelling running and carrying on in the lobby. Not constantly of course but frequently enough to be a bother. Nothing seemed to be being done about this despite the late hour (it’s a hotel after all not a party hostel) and I tried to be patient but ended up having to complain on my last night as I had an early start and it was loud enough to hear down the hall through my noise cancelling headphones. There was no one at reception so I had to message the property through the Booking app. I would not recommend this hotel if you are looking for peace and quiet as you will not find it here.'),\n",

We even had one night when I could not sleep due to screaming and banging on doors all night and when we reported this situation they said the manager was in the hotel during the night so he probably was aware of the noise - not giving any solution or explanation.

Hotel: Alexis Hotel. Negative Guest Review: we booked 7 nights at Alexis Hotel on a bed/breakfast/evening dinner basis. It is not made clear that the evening dinner is an al a carte selection menu with a limit on the amount of spend of 12 euro's. We were expecting a buffet style evening meal which is usually normal for half board hotels. It was not just that we had paid for half board in our booking and then having to pay at least 15 euro each evening as most main courses were over the 12 euro limit. Personally we found ALL the food on the menu VERY VERY salty oregano and salty cheese. To the point that we dreaded evening meals after 2 days of our stay but as we had paid for half board we felt captive to eat in the restaurant. Some people who love Cretean food (very salty and herbs) would disagree with my assessment but it is done in good faith and to genuinely inform others. The restaurant staff did do everything they could to ask the cook to not use extra salt but were restricted by most of the menu choices were pre or partial cooked already. Bottle of 0.75 litre water was 4.50 euro We met another British couple who had just booked Bed and Breakfast (buffet style) and ate in the restaurant 2 out of 7 nights and were of course able to eat elsewhere for similar price or less. Other than the food not to our taste all was 100% great. My strong advice is to stay at Alexis Hotel but on a bed and breakfast basis. That is my only reason for the 6.0 score.\\n\\nHotel: Alexis Hotel. Positive Guest Review: Breakfast variety was very limited and cold.

The starters are also highly recommended.. Hotel: Alexis Hotel. Negative Guest Review: Unfortunately, the breakfast buffet is not comparable to the evening meal. You shouldn't expect too much here - we were disappointed by the artificial-tasting juices, only one type of packaged jam, soft toast and not very tasty coffee. The dining room's inventory includes two cats that beg insistently and sometimes sit on the empty chairs. A packed lunch booked for an excursion included 2 double slices of toast with ham and cheese and 2 juice packets for two people - that was very poor and disappointed us.

It's difficult if you don't eat pork because unfortunately most of the dishes at breakfast and dinner contain pork. You always have to make a reservation for dinner because it's usually full and there is no opening buffet. You can only choose a few dishes from the menu. But I think that's enough.

We had read that it was one of the best restaurants in Chania (it's true that a lot of people come from outside the hotel) so we took half board thinking it would be buffet style but it wasn't. The restaurant offers you a menu that consists of bread, a starter to choose from (somewhat limited options), a main course that shouldn't exceed €12 (otherwise you pay the difference) and dessert (drinks are paid for separately). The quantities are huge and the food itself is good but quite focused on Greek cuisine. In my case I don't like cheese and it was difficult to choose (for 2-3 days at most it's fine, we were 5 and we ended up a bit saturated every time dinner arrived). In the end we ended up choosing more expensive options of 12€ and paying the difference… I recommend looking at the menu before choosing half board. - Remember to give the card they give you for dinner as a member of the hotel once you are at the table.

Negative Guest Review: While breakfast was very tasty the coffee was below any standard. Honestly a giant pot of instant coffee while you have a bar with a perfectly functioning espresso machine is a little bit clumsy looking. In the end had to order and pay for decent coffee every day at breakfast which is kind of disappointing given how nice and luxurious the vibe of the place is.

From the moment I arrived I was greeted with warmth and hospitality that made me feel right at home. The standout stars of my experience were undoubtedly the front desk girls Isabella and Mary. Their exceptional level of accommodation and super friendly demeanor added an extra layer of joy to my stay. Another highlight of my stay were the incredible waitresses Labrini and Stavroula. Their attentive service and genuine kindness made each dining experience even more enjoyable. The staff at Alsus Boutique Hotel truly goes above and beyond to make every guest feel like a VIP. And speaking of going above and beyond the staff even helped coordinate a room upgrade as a surprise when they learned about my recent engagement in Santorini. This unexpected gesture made my stay even more special and unforgettable. I must mention that I eagerly looked forward to Loukoumades every morning during breakfast. The delectable treat added a touch of local flavor to my mornings and it was a delightful way to start each day. All in all my stay at the Alsus Boutique Hotel was an unforgettable experience. The combination of top-notch service prime location near Amoudara Beach the exceptional hospitality of Isabella Mary Labrini and Stavroula and my daily Loukoumades ritual truly made this vacation one for the books. I can't wait to return to this little slice of paradise in the future!. Hotel: Alsus Boutique Hotel - Adults Only. Negative Guest Review: No Loukoumades on my last day😒😭 It’s would have been great if they also mentioned on the site the although it is a Adults only hotel the swimming pool restaurant and bar is open to the public which in my opinion takes away the charm of it being a Adults Only hotel. The public pays 4€ and can stay the whole day. So either advertise it that this is the case or have it open to the public on certain days only.\"),\n",

Negative Guest Review: The old/unrenovated rooms really don’t match the vibe of the rest of the hotel. Also the images of the old standard rooms were (at least on booking.com) only at the very bottom of all the photos so in case you didn’t look through all 50 or so photos of the hotel you totally miss how the room will look like. To me it looks like the hotel advertised very prominently the newly renovated rooms and hides the “old rooms”. The standarm room (“old room”) doesn’t look as pretty the bathroom was tiny - especially the shower - and not completely clean with lots of repair marks. In the shower was no fixture to hold your shower gel/shampoo. The room was also so small that you weren’t able to have 2 suitcases open we had to move furniture around in order to do so. The sunbeds are very basic (not super comfy) and there are no sun umbrellas in the garden. There are 3 sun kiosks for which you have to pay 20€ to use them. This is because the hotel is more like a local swimming pool. That means local habitants can come lie in the garden and use the pool so even if there aren’t many hotel guests the pool area is quite busy with a lot of local 18-20 year olds.\\n\\nHotel: Alsus Boutique Hotel - Adults Only.

Hotel: Alsus Boutique Hotel - Adults Only. Negative Guest Review: Safe was broken Charged to use cabana beds 20euros for pool hours 9-7 afterwards it’s free but by that point you’re done with the sunbathing and getting ready to head out seems a bit cheeky given your a paying guest. They don’t tell you they are providing a cleaning service for the room. Whilst this is a positive we didn’t know and considering we had no safe we were unsettled when we realised they had been in without our knowledge. Luckily no issues in terms of our possessions or valuables. Not all rooms are modernised so if you’re unlucky you’ll get an older furnished room. Check pictures at the end of their advertising. The new rooms are upstairs or first three down stairs with private pool. They do look good. Semi open to the locals to use the facilities whilst this isn’t necessarily an issue it does create a crowded pool area less available sun beds. Staff tend to ask locals if they want service rather than tourist guests. We were asked only once during our stay. On the main road and everyone has access to the premises even via the car park. Anyone can walk through to the back of the hotel round the side to the pool area. Photos are deceptive it’s a small hotel. Yes a boutique but the sun bathing area is small limited number of seats Next to a construction site and is semi visible. Whilst this is not an issue for our stay as there were no works taking place this could be an issue if they decide to continue building. Hotel does not mention this at time of booking so would check.

But we got so much more as Manos and Gina and the rest of the team were fantastic. They treated and looked after us just like family. They had an answer to all our queries from what were the best restaurants to buying olive oil and Raki. Our hotel room was perfect and just what we needed. It was a very clean room with comfortable beds and a lovely shower. I chose the triple room with a shower. It had a double bed that converted to 2 singles (if needed) and sofa bed. We had a lovely quite room facing the back street (entrance to the hotel). You should also know the hotel has an amazing shared balcony view near the reception desk where you can sit and admire the view and meet lots of the other lovely guests! Would I stay there again? Yes a thousand times - thank you - thank you - thank you - Manos and Gina...we miss you already! And we will be back...xx. Hotel: Amphitrite Hotel.

From the brilliant recommendations for places to eat to the attention to detail in the quality cleanliness and comfort of the rooms and the provision of beach towels and an umbrella for a day on the beach. Our room had a balcony with amazing views across the old Venetian harbour not that we spent much time in it as we were too busy enjoying all the culinary delights that Chania has to offer. We didn't have a car as everything we needed for a relaxing week was within walking distance - a stone's throw from a wide range of eateries on the waterfront and a 20 minute stroll to Nea Chora beach..

I could walk to all the main sightseeing sites and also could take nice seaside walk. I could walk to bus station in 10 min and take a bus to the Botanical Garden Rethemno  Chania Airport etc. I also took a day tour called ‘7 villages’ which was quite nice as we visited some traditional villages where we could see olive oil mill raki production village bakeries traditional Cretan cheese making as well as nice food and wonderful lunch in a village. I would highly recommend this trip. I think Botanical Garden is also wonderful and worth spending time and having a delicious lunch there. It is a 45 min or so bus ride from Chania.

We had the only room with a balcony and when we first opened the doors we were knocked out by the view over the harbour with the lighthouse straight ahead. The harbour is a pedestrianised area so our taxi had to drop us off outside the zone but Zena one of the lovely ladies running the hotel came to meet us a carry our luggage. The greeting she and the other ladies gave us was warm and welcoming. Our rate included breakfast which was amazing. We chose the Greek yogurt with fruit and granola followed by poached eggs with either bacon or avocado with freshly squeezed orange juice and tea or coffee. It was absolutely delicious and sustained us throughout the day. Unfortunately we only had three nights at the Anissa and we were very sad to leave.. Hotel: Anassa Chania Boutique Hotel.

Earplugs were provided after complain but still it was not a good experience. - Our window overlooked other window and we could see how someone was getting dressed up or vise versa (picture attached) thus we needed to keep the curtains closed with the lights turned on during the day. - Our room was much narrower than we expected  bed was tightly between the walls and window before we only experienced this in a low budget hotels. Overall cleanliness of the room and bath were enjoyable however definitly pricey for Greece and for the room we got even when considering the location.

Positive Guest Review: The rooftop with view over Chania harbor is amazing and the hotel is located in a prime spot in the city.. Hotel: Anassa Chania Boutique Hotel. Negative Guest Review: It is not really a hotel per se (there is no dedicated reception for customers for example there is just the bar counter) and then you have direct access to the rooms upstairs even if the staff is very nice it is not necessarily what you expect for such a price. Even if the room is spacious it is not necessarily well arranged for the one on the 1st floor with the balcony. The toilet and shower are in the same small space and after a shower the floor is therefore wet up to the toilet which is not very practical not to mention the fact that in the absence of a waterproof seal between this space and the room if you are not careful you could flood the room during a shower..). Moreover for the balcony it is very small and the furniture that has been installed is far too imposing which means that you cannot really be comfortable on this balcony not to mention the fact that really everyone can see you even several hundred meters from the hotel there is no privacy possible on this balcony so in the end you cannot really enjoy it it is better to go to the rooftop. Disappointment also for breakfast with only three possible choices (yogurt with muesli/honey a toast with eggs and a fruit/cheese platter). And if you are a light sleeper you absolutely need earplugs because if you are on the 1st floor you will not be able to sleep without them..(because of the location in the center of the port it is very lively until very late at night and it starts again early in the morning with the trucks arriving to resupply the restaurants/bars..).'),\n",

Negative Guest Review: Even if the view is magnificent, you should know that for the rooms overlooking the port, the noise is omnipresent from 7am to 4am the following day :) In the evening, the bass of the music goes through the double glazing and even with earplugs (provided by the hotel) it is difficult to sleep... and the bars/nightclubs throw their glass bottles around 4am. So it is better to abstain if you value your sleep :) considering the price of the room, I find it expensive to not sleep well in the end.\\n\\nHotel: Anassa Chania Boutique Hotel.

After a night with a constant clicking noise from the fuse box, we switched to an apartment which luckily was unoccupied because it was late in the season and the bedroom faced the sea. A major advantage!! There are a few things that could be improved, such as the lighting being far too bright everywhere, no shower, just a bathtub, and in the kitchen some things like making coffee, using the stove, kettle, toaster, etc. are only possible if another function is not supposed to be taking place at the same time because it is too small for everything and there are not enough sockets. Unfortunately the sofa bed in the kitchen area could not be used because the fridge was very loud.

She organized the car rental directly from Heraklion airport and everything went smoothly. If we had any questions or problems, she was always there to help and advise and responded immediately. For Greek Orthodox Easter, she brought us Easter eggs and homemade cake, which tasted fantastic. The entire service staff is nice and friendly, and the lady who took care of the daily cleaning of the apartment deserves special mention. I have rarely entered cleaner rooms and after we arrived back home, I look back wistfully and wish she was here but she didn't fit in my suitcase anymore 😉. We had the beautifully designed apartment no. 9, now equipped with a brand new induction stove 😉 with a fantastic sea view and a huge balcony with a 270 degree view of the sea and mountains, on which my daughter ran about 7 1/2 marathons. The outdoor facilities are very well maintained and the view of the sea and especially the sunset is incredibly beautiful. We (my potential wife, my almost two-year-old daughter and I) had a wonderful time in Plakias and on Crete and the team at Anthos Apartments definitely contributed to that. I can recommend the accommodation without reservation, whether as a family, a retired couple, a recently divorced couple or a happy single.

The sink is very small and there aren't enough shelves by the sink. There isn't a single power socket in the bathroom. The kitchen is very poorly equipped. We bought a salad bowl ourselves and there are no small bowls for dessert, for example. The cooking utensils are also very poor. Overall, the price-performance ratio is not appropriate. The bed mattresses were very uncomfortable. We had the feeling that we could feel the individual springs. Definitely not suitable for people who watch their backs. The lighting in the living-dining room was only provided by a large ceiling lamp which gave off an uncomfortable light. It wasn't pleasant in the evenings.

They were all shirty because we arrived 5 mins after 10. Also room instructions (such as breakfast times) are provided with one illegible hand-written note taped inside the back entrance to the hotel.

Then we discovered how dirty it was under the bed with lots of dust and 2 bottles of creams from the previous guest. The mirror on the wall was also so loose that if you accidently would have leaned on it it probably would have fallen off the well. Generally we found the finishings just not done up to par. We stayed in a private room at the kumba hostel before and found the value for money was way better there. Room and bathroom were much bigger and yes it was a bit further out of the centre but a lovely walk down the boulevard. I think I would prefer to stay there again next time. Due to the fact that the room was not really clean and dry and it not being able to sort that out before we left it might have been nice if maybe we were offered a coffee/drink on the house  Breakfast is unfortunately also nothing special some dry toast jam ( no choice in flavours) an egg and some juice ftom a carton box.

If you want to sleep after 8.00 in the morning you will not be able to. 2. A second problem was that the rooms are very tiny and the things of 2 people can not properly fit.

The bed was comfy and the sea view from the bed is fantastic. I also really enjoyed the location close to the Koum Kapi bars and the old town of Chania. The breakfast is good and sufficient but you have to tell them yourself in case there's anything you can't or don't want to eat. I was never asked for preferences.. Hotel: Kumba At Koum Kapi. Negative Guest Review: I'd recommend asking for a quiet room further away from the bar next door which can get noisy at times. The building next to the hotel is currently under construction and they work at odd times (not at night though). And since the rooms' doors are not soundproof you will also hear the elevator and pretty much anything else that is happening on your floor. So if you're a light sleeper bring earplugs. I didn't understand the cleaning concept and couldn't find a please make up my room/please do not disturb hanger in my room. I stayed for seven nights - on the first three days my bed was made and I got more new towels than I had used or ever could use. I'd much rather have the towel for the bathroom floor exchanged a little more often. Because these showers ... phew they don't make any sense at all. There is no way to comfortably use it and not flood the entire bathroom. That is because there is no shower curtain or door to prevent the water from just spreading anywhere. In case you decide to use the rain shower head there's a good chance that you will flood the bedroom too. So I found it to be useless. The bathroom could also use some shelf space in the shower to store your toiletries and a (working) hanger for (drying soaked bathroom floor) towels. During my remaining stay there was no more cleaning anymore so I had to ask for more toilet paper and the coffee in my room didn’t get refilled either. Sadly I didn't find my room to be very well cleaned to begin with. The bedsheets were stained (old stains I assume that didn’t get removed by washing) I found paper in the trash bin and used socks behind the wardrobe (I didn't dare to remove them so they're probably still there). The furniture on the balcony could use some basic cleaning too.\"),\n",

So we pack our bags then in the middle of the day we are called to tell us that we have not put our things away when we have... A little stressful. I ask how the check out works: I am told to just leave the key in the door. However in the afternoon I receive a message to tell me that they cannot debit my card so I have to add their bank account to be able to make the transfer. A little stressful for my taste. I think that in 2 weeks the hotel will be finished and it will be better.\\n\\nHotel: Kumba At Koum Kapi. Positive Guest Review: The location is good but also very noisy due to a lot of traffic..

Air Con control unit was a bit tricky - I was ok with it but I can imagine others getting into a mess with it.

I could literally read in bed with all the in room lights out at night. The curtains on the street level windows also were inadequate to block light from street. The room was also noisy being on street level. Obviously no one associated with this hotel had test run this room- or these issues would have been addressed. We could not change rooms- as we were told we had the last room- even though we reserved months in advance. It's hard to believe no one had ever complained about that room. Additionally at breakfast they would not allow us to fill a water bottle with the filtered water from the machine - which seemed very petty.

It was one of the cheaper hotels available for me so that was a plus. It is also very close to the airport and the port and there are bus stops a few meters from it. This meant that I could quickly get to Heraklion's bus station in time to catch the bus service to other towns. You can also get to the old town quickly. What this means is that Asterion Hotel is an affordable and very good option if you want to use Heraklion as your home base and taking day trips to other towns. The staff too was very friendly. They deserve a 5-star. Though I must say that Crete has a very hospitable culture so you'll be meeting plenty of friendly faces. If you are like me -- I was going on my own and planning to visit archaeological sites so I was on the adventurous side of things -- then Asterion Hotel might be a really good option. There's also a laundry just down the street you can drop your clothes there and they'll deliver it back at the hotel. So that's great if you're on a long trip. There's also a cheap restaurant right across the street and a little stall selling bus tickets.. Hotel: Asterion Hotel.

It is more profitable to buy things from the supermarket and eat them on a bench in the park. Besides if you are used to using solid soap buy one because they only have shower gels here.\\n\\nHotel: Asterion Hotel. Positive Guest Review: The price the balcony the staff helped out..

Breakfast: Buffet with a wide variety of sweets, savoury, fruit, dairy, coffee, juices, different types of bread. Location: The hotel is a 20-minute walk from the airport, however it is not a suitable path to walk. It is a 30-minute walk from the centre. However, it is perfect for the bus. The stop is next to the hotel. In less than 10 minutes you are in the centre, at the nearest beach (Karteros) or at the airport. The bus tickets can be bought on the bus itself or at a kiosk right in front of the hotel, where the kiosk owner is also wonderful.

The air conditioning unit in the room was very old and half the display unit doesn’t work so you have to guess what temperature you have set it on. Your deck is shared with the hotel laundry so it is not your private deck. The cleaners did the best they could but the bathroom was very tired and old with cracks in the shower floor. The location of the hotel gave a good view but was too far from the beach with a very hot walk back from a swim. Generally it was not as good as we expected for the price.

There was a large selection of food so there was something for every taste. We enjoyed starting the day with a delicious breakfast. There were always enough parking spaces in front of the hotel so we didn't have to worry about a safe parking space. The location of the hotel was also very advantageous. The beautiful beach was only about 5 to 7 minutes walk away and the city center could also be reached in just five minutes. Supermarkets were very close to the hotel and a bus stop was directly opposite. Overall, we were more than happy with our stay at the Astoria Hotel and would love to visit again.

The beds are very comfortable and there are three different pillows to choose from. As I chose a cheap standard room, I was not surprised not to find a luxury bathroom, but a sparkling clean, functional bathroom with standard fittings, an 80x80 shower tray with a brand new shower curtain. My nagging contemporaries with the highest expectations of the bathroom fittings who give negative reviews should please refrain from doing so, considering the low room price, and instead book in the corresponding price categories above €100 in the future. If you want to enjoy the great sea view shown in the pictures, you have to choose the suite on the roof. Because I enjoyed my stay so much, I immediately extended it by a day and came back for another night on the way home after a week.. Hotel: Astoria Hotel.

Also my adult daughters were not allowed to have their two friends come up to their room to just hang out after having dinner together. My daughters made it clear that the friends were not spending the night since they were staying at another hotel in the area. Also our scheduled ferry from another island was canceled due to high winds and we were unable to make it to Crete on our scheduled check in day. I was disappointed that we were still responsible for paying for the one night we were not there even though that cancellation was out of our control. I understand that this is legal policy with Greek government but somehow I feel that they should make exceptions for these instances.

Someone give the man some real work to do or put him in a home for old people. Reception lady - try smiling and don’t look at guests up and down as they approach the desk. It’s appalling and rude.

They have an 11 space onsite carpark for the entire hotel and you have to call from the gate for entry if it's not full.

Breakfast definitely could have been more vegetarian friendly. No indications of whether things like cheeses were vegetarian (without rennet) or not and the only hot options seemed to be eggs.

It’s two blocks to the ocean the Rocca del Mare fortress and seafood restaurants along the water. It’s two blocks to the astonishing Heraklion Archaeological Museum (Minoan culture from 7000 B.C.) Museum of Ancient Greek Technology and other museums. Two blocks the other way is the city’s heart at the Morosini Fountain with dozens of outdoor cafes featuring farm-fresh Cretan specialties. From the hotel we easily walked to all these sights: https://goo.gl/maps/EyDhWcY9tRmg3nev5 We especially liked the hotel staff. Katerina and Stephanos at Reception were so welcoming and helpful meeting our requests for items in the room. Maria and Margarita in the restaurant were so friendly and attentive always greeting us with a big smile and finding the table we needed. Margarita helped us every morning by making a special mix of decaffeinated cappuccino just for my tender tummy. The breakfast buffet is spectacular–even an excellent Italian brut champagne. Bruschetta and mushrooms and all kinds of spanakopita tasted freshly baked from scratch. The omelette station was great.. Hotel: Aquila Atlantis Hotel. Negative Guest Review: We were disappointed that our Executive Room with Harbor View was not. The hotel's online photos show a lovely view of the sea from the balconies--but it’s not true. Harbor ships can be seen off to the left but the main view from the balconies is the roof of a derelict building below. We hardly used our balcony. Online photos also feature fine views of the Rocca del Mare and the ocean but we couldn’t see that at all from anywhere in the hotel. There may be some view of it from the hotel’s rooftop pool which was advertised to be open April 1 - September 30. But we were there in April and the roof was locked closed. The rooms are glamorous as a photo shoot but too sleek to live in. No drawers for clothing no drawers in night tables. Shower stall sculpted faux marble sink and WC closet have no counter space and no place to hang anything.\"),\n",

On arrival I was advised that parking could not be confirmed and I was not signposted in a helpful way to potential places to park (even if costed). I thought this advice could have been helpful rather than the general reference to parking as per restrictions. The whole plan had to change in this basis as we could not find nearby long stay.

When we arrived, however, we were told that the 11 parking spaces (few for the size of the hotel) were all taken and that we would have to use a parking garage, which really annoyed us at the time. The ladies at reception said that we could always check to see if there was a free parking space in the hotel's parking space... luckily my husband drove straight there and hey presto - a parking space was free! :-) For a five-star hotel, I found it very strange that you don't have an overview of which guest is using a hotel parking space or whether/how these parking spaces are occupied or not.

Old hotel that deserves to be renovated. 2 swimming pools (1 on the ground floor and the second on the roof) tiny. Good for splashing around and cooling off. The most negative point: an unbearable smell in the entrance of the room and the bathroom. At first we thought it was caustic soda. After complaining to the reception, we were sent a cleaning lady who cleaned the entire bathroom with a perfumed product. Result: the smell came back after 30 minutes. Impossible to change rooms. Fortunately we stayed 2 nights. We slept with the window open. After my own research I found the origin of the smell: mold behind the bar fridge.'),\n",

The air conditioning system was too noisy as was the fridge (we had to disconnect it at night). The flush button was loose. The system to close the blinds/window was not great and the balcony was ridiculously small - good enough to hang swimwear and towels but that's it. Also we had twin beds put together as opposed to a double bed which is quite annoying if you're visiting with your partner.\"),\n",

Right next to the city center easy to access different points of interest while quiet enough for a good nights sleep. The rooms were also pretty good but the AC worked better in some that others.. Hotel: Atrion Hotel. Negative Guest Review: Two things stuck with us. First there were issues with the elevator. Sometimes it wouldn’t go all the way to the necessary floor and we’d have to manually open the doors and step up out of it. We got stuck multiple times! Second - the breakfast. While the in-house version was quite good one day we couldn’t make it cause of an early day trip. We asked about it at reception wondering if e could have breakfast any earlier and they said they could prepare take away boxes. Sounded wonderful and of course we agreed. We shouldn’t have. Each box had a sandwich made of two dry peace’s of bread with an extremely thin layer of meat and cheese a small muffin an apple and some water. The sandwich was almost inedible.
