The temperature in our room did not go below 75° the entire time we stayed and got up to 79° on hotter times throughout the day. We were able to crack a window at night so it wasn’t just stagnant, but NYC is very loud at all times so this wasn’t ideal and it was still very uncomfortable to sleep let alone try to do anything in the room. Beyond the AC, there were just some minor things I thought were inconvenient. There were no washcloths available in the room when we arrived so we had to call for some. Also, there was no clothing steamer in the room like had been posted in each room’s amenities list.

Ariel,United States,Single Room,8 nights,Solo traveller,11-11-2023 00:00:00,Nice basic hotel near Times Square making it easy to get everything done in the City,7.0,en-us,"The staff of the hotel made my stay - always nice and reactive. Whatever they're being paid, they deserve a raise from the hotel! The building is the historic Paramount theatre, with lots of nice photos from the past throughout. I stayed for 2 weeks and the room was regularly cleaned and felt fresh. The location is right next to Times Square, close to everything, making it easy to get things done.","The bathroom supplies (soap, shower gel, hair shampoo) were very small, and were not replaced daily, even though they are supposed to be. I stayed for 2 full weeks, and had to ask the reception for these supplies to be replenished on multiple evenings. The reception immediately did this, but I shouldn't even have to ask for this in the first place. I am paying a lot of money to stay here for multiple weeks, and my room is supposed to receive the same attention every day as if it was different guests staying here every day. Separate point: the hotel lobby is beautiful but the lighting is SO dark it is sometimes hard to even see things in it properly. I guess similarly to the situation with the bathroom supplies, with the lighting, the hotel should spend a few extra dollars to have proper lighting in the lobby. These small cost cuts are making your guests' experiences worse, and it just feels unnecessarily cheap.","title: Nice basic hotel near Times Square making it easy to get everything done in the City. liked: The staff of the hotel made my stay - always nice and reactive.

If you are not a person that streams TV/Movies from a device, then you're out of luck at this hotel - the in-room TVs only function using ChromeCast.

Niemi,United States,Queen Room - Disability Access,1 night,Family,06-21-2023 00:00:00,Pleasant,6.0,en-us,The location of the hotel is fantastic & the price was affordable. The bed was comfortable.,"The temp in our room on arrival was 84°F. The A/C seemed to work fairly quickly in cooling the room down to a bearabletemperature. Later though was an issue with the A/C like it would overheat & just start blowing HOT air. I kept having to shut it off throughout the night because the room was too hot. The lobby & elevators had a strange vibe as the lighting was very very dim, so much so that I turned on my phone flashlight to clearly see the floor numbers in the elevator. My guess is that if it was well lit guests might clearly see issues there. I had requested early check-in & received a confirmation email that stated we would be able to check-in at noon & there wouldn't be an extra charge. When we arrived the front desk person initially told me it would be $50 for our early check-in, but luckily I had the email stating otherwise.","title: Pleasant. liked: The location of the hotel is fantastic & the price was affordable.

Terrific staff. liked: Thank you for providing a safe space in the heart of the city. The staff were excellent and accommodating and at the end of the day the experience eventhough the room description did not meet our expectations, we were still able to fulfill the intention of the trip. The linen was clean. disliked: I was under the impression I booked a king size deluxe or HC room. and the pictures showed a very large, clean modern setting. What we actually received on arrival was a switch to a very small older room with two beds and only the essentials. It was suppose to be a surprise trip for someone and the intention was to choose a really nice but modest room. It felt like a bait and switch experience on the site since I had previously found other options closer to the aiport which had really modern rooms with amenities. I was not able to lock them in for some reason, so I chose this one. I thought I had secured a better value with this booking, but was disappointed when we unlocked the door to the room. I still give a good rating to Paramount because at the end of the day the EXPERIENCE it provided so close to Times Square was the real intention of the journey. Despite the amenities (no ice buckets etc in the room, no table lamps, AC stopped cooling in our room after a certain hour etc.) It was a safe place to stay in an excellent location.

They will charge it again on arrival!",3.0,en-us,Good locations. That is all I really have to say that is positive about this location.,"Room was not cleaned well. Hair in the bathtub and on the bathroom floor and they do not use trash can liners so the inside of the cans were not cleanly. There is ongoing construction on the building and if you have a room with windows to it you get to hear the workers chit-chat the whole time if you are in the room at all during the daytime. At night the old windows do absolutely nothing to block the noises of the city. Don't expect to sleep. BEWARE Booking.com lists on your bill and you have pre-paid the resort fee but when you arrive they will charge you the $40 fee AGAIN. I don't know if the problem is from booking or the hotel but if the fee is $80 per night they should just say that rather than trying to double charge people. I've checked my bank and my bill from Booking and as far as that all lists I DID pay my $40 resort fee at booking, but the hotel maintains that I did not and charged me again and I have not been able to get any of that back. So please know that the actual use fee is $80 plus extra taxes PER NIGHT. If booking says you paid $40 you will have to pay another $40 and more taxes ABOVE the price you paid at booking when you arrive, PER NIGHT. Absolutely not worth it in any way for their incredibly limited amenities. There wasn't even conditioner in the bathroom. If you travel light anticipating using hotel amenities beware that this one offers essentially none even though they are going to charge you a resort fee for them. Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else. UPDATE - It seems they have issued the refund on the double fee. BUT BE AWARE!! Check your bill through booking and your charges to your card. If you already paid the fee through them make sure to bring this up at check-in!! It was a hassle to get it back and nothing happened with it, other than for them to tell me the $40 fee was due at the hotel, until I left this review.","title: If your bill says you paid the resort fee, it doesn't matter.

I don't know if the problem is from booking or the hotel but if the fee is $80 per night they should just say that rather than trying to double charge people. I've checked my bank and my bill from Booking and as far as that all lists I DID pay my $40 resort fee at booking, but the hotel maintains that I did not and charged me again and I have not been able to get any of that back. So please know that the actual use fee is $80 plus extra taxes PER NIGHT. If booking says you paid $40 you will have to pay another $40 and more taxes ABOVE the price you paid at booking when you arrive, PER NIGHT. Absolutely not worth it in any way for their incredibly limited amenities. There wasn't even conditioner in the bathroom. If you travel light anticipating using hotel amenities beware that this one offers essentially none even though they are going to charge you a resort fee for them. Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else. UPDATE - It seems they have issued the refund on the double fee. BUT BE AWARE!! Check your bill through booking and your charges to your card. If you already paid the fee through them make sure to bring this up at check-in!! It was a hassle to get it back and nothing happened with it, other than for them to tell me the $40 fee was due at the hotel, until I left this review.","title: If your bill says you paid the resort fee, it doesn't matter.

Hair in the bathtub and on the bathroom floor and they do not use trash can liners so the inside of the cans were not cleanly.

Pushpa,United States,Superior Queen Room,1 night,Group,10-01-2024 00:00:00,Didn’t meet my expectations! Tiny rooms and no water bottle/ shampoo,1.0,en-us,I like the Location,"I was highly disappointed with my recent stay at this hotel. The rooms were incredibly small and lacked even basic amenities like bottled water. I had family friends visiting from Qatar, and I felt embarrassed by the subpar service and inadequate rooms we were provided. One of the worst aspects was the absence of essential toiletries – they only offered body wash and hand wash, with no shampoo available. When I asked one of the staff members about parking options, instead of offering assistance or even speaking, she merely pointed to a barcode to scan. To make matters worse, there is no valet service. When I finally found the garage, they told me it was already full, and I had to park at the Hilton hotel’s garage, which was a mile away. This added significant inconvenience to an already unpleasant experience. Suggestions for Improvement: 1. Room Size & Amenities: Consider offering complimentary bottled water in the rooms and expanding the available amenities, such as shampoo and conditioner. Guests appreciate having these basics without needing to ask. 2. Customer Service Training: Improve staff communication and train them to be more helpful and responsive to guest inquiries. It’s essential that they not only assist with questions but also provide clear directions and solutions. 3. Valet Service or Parking Assistance: Implement a valet service or provide more convenient parking arrangements. If parking is unavailable, guests should be informed ahead of time, and alternative options should be easily accessible and closer to the hotel. 4. Enhance the Guest Experience: Overall, ensuring that guests feel welcomed and well taken care of should be a priority. Little improvements in service and convenience can make a big difference in guest satisfaction.","title: Didn’t meet my expectations!

Diana,Ukraine,Double Room,3 nights,Group,02-21-2024 00:00:00,I’d rata wit differently but those two things made my stay rated low.,4.0,en,Great location and the hotel overall is nice,"First thing that really spoiled the impression is the fact that tho we were two people, for some reason we were given the tiny room for 1 with one single bed, so obviously we addressed that to the reception and they gave us a different room for two, but we had to move back and forth with the luggage and it was a discomfort after the long flight — not the best experience. The other thing that I was just astonished by was the fact that leaving your luggage in the storage before check in was NOT free of charge but $2 per bad before check in and $3 after check in — why on earth would the price differ and why is it even paid “service” in the 4 stars hotel? I Tavel a lot and it’s the first time I had to pay the hotel for luggage storage when I already paid quite good money for my stay at the hotel — what is more, they consider a backpack and a carry on luggage as a separate item/ bag each so it really doesn’t matter that my two bags were the size of the regular checked luggage I still had to pay for each item separately when it takes even less space in the storage than one item of checked baggage, but the cost to me is higher.

Pat,United States,Double Room,1 night,Solo traveller,01-22-2024 00:00:00,"Great value and location, clean rooms, comfortable beds, and friendly staff!",9.0,en-us,"The Paramount is a discount hotel, but it does not feel like one. The staff is friendly, its rooms are small but comfortable and clean, and it is located near Times Square, most Broadway theaters, and dozens of quality restaurants, pizza joints, and fast food chains. Set your expectations right and you will have a great experience. I have stayed there three times, basically to catch shows before flying home the next day, and had a great time every time. Do not expect wonderful views from your windows, a resort experience, or a restaurant or room service in the hotel. That is not what the Paramount is about. Pros: - One of the best values in the theater district. - Location, location, location. Short walk to many theaters and restaurants. One block away from ""Restaurant Row"" for pre- and post-show meals. - Clean rooms with great heating/AC. Comfortable beds. Solid, free Wi-fi. - Friendly front desk staff. - They will store your luggage if you arrive before check-in time, so you can go have fun in the city. ""History is happening in Manhattan and we Just happen to be in the greatest city in the world. In the greatest city in the world!"" Yes, Hamilton is playing just down the street, on the same block!","Cons: - There seems to be issues with their old elevators every time I stay there. Nothing too serious. If the first one does not work, wait for the next one. There are four elevators, just do not expect all of them to be working. - No restaurant in the hotel, so you cannot fuel up before going sightseeing. - They are popular with tour groups, so sometimes you will walk in as busloads of tourists are waiting in the spacious lobby for their rooms. Just something to be aware of. Pro tip: In lieu of a Paramount restaurant, you can, cross the street and enjoy the restaurants in the Marriott Marquis. You do not have to be a guest there to eat in their restaurants, and their main restaurant, located in their huge atrium, has a breakfast buffet and a la carte items. Just cross the street from the Paramount, head left, and you will see the hotel's driveway. Go in through the glass doors and up the escalators or elevators to the reception desk level, as if you were checking in. You do not need a room key to go there and that is where the restaurants and convenience store (beauty products, over the counter meds, USB cables, snacks, sundries) are located.","title: Great value and location, clean rooms, comfortable beds, and friendly staff! liked: The Paramount is a discount hotel, but it does not feel like one. The staff is friendly, its rooms are small but comfortable and clean, and it is located near Times Square, most Broadway theaters, and dozens of quality restaurants, pizza joints, and fast food chains. Set your expectations right and you will have a great experience. I have stayed there three times, basically to catch shows before flying home the next day, and had a great time every time. Do not expect wonderful views from your windows, a resort experience, or a restaurant or room service in the hotel. That is not what the Paramount is about. Pros: - One of the best values in the theater district. - Location, location, location. Short walk to many theaters and restaurants. One block away from ""Restaurant Row"" for pre- and post-show meals. - Clean rooms with great heating/AC. Comfortable beds. Solid, free Wi-fi. - Friendly front desk staff. - They will store your luggage if you arrive before check-in time, so you can go have fun in the city. ""History is happening in Manhattan and we Just happen to be in the greatest city in the world. In the greatest city in the world!"" Yes, Hamilton is playing just down the street, on the same block! disliked: Cons: - There seems to be issues with their old elevators every time I stay there. Nothing too serious.

Tiger,United States,Superior Room with 2 Twin Beds,1 night,Couple,01-13-2024 00:00:00,If you weren't near Times Square this property would be completely useless crap!!!,1.0,en-us,The location very near Times Square is the ONLY positive part of this hotel experience.,"Every single time we stay here, the heat/ac doesn't work...at all. They FINALLY upgraded to digital thermostats, BUT THEY STILL DON'T WORK. Called the desk to send someone, never showed. The safety lock handle that keeps the door from being opened fell off in my hand! The key card works for the elevator 25% of the time, really annoying. So annoying that everyone in the elevator gets out their key cards to try to make it work. The ""bar"" is behind sheetrock and plastic sheeting and doesn't stock hardly any thing to drink. I know! Hard seltzer is really exotic these days right? And the only way I could get the early check in I requested with my reservation was to buy an upgrade! Surely ONE ROOM had been cleaned by 1:30! And no breakfast anymore? Why? It was an awesome buffet. And WHY WHY WHY DO YOU ALLOW EVERY TRAVELER, HOBO AND THEIR BROTHER TO HANG OUT IN THE LOBBY ALL HOURS OF THE DAY AND NIGHT???? We didn't feel safe. Especially since the lock fell off the door! I know the construction across the street is not their fault but it's been going on for a very loooong time. If you don't mind getting up by 7AM, you'll be fine. This place is not worth the low price to stay in NYC.","title: If you weren't near Times Square this property would be completely useless crap!!! liked: The location very near Times Square is the ONLY positive part of this hotel experience. disliked: Every single time we stay here, the heat/ac doesn't work...at all.

Im shocked its that expensive. The toilet paper is the thin type, the one that you need half a roll every time you use the bathroom. The AC doesnt work. There is no view, just a wall in front of the window. Traffic is crazy, its faster to walk. Walls are thin, you can hear all your neighbors. Its very poor quality, but im not sure if this city offers any good hotels at an affordable price. One day is enough in this dumpster.","title: Too expensive, poor quality.

The gym was closed due to maintenance, which is surprising given how small it is. No complimentary breakfast. To store your luggage after checkout, it will cost $2 per bag. This is ver reasonable!

My girlfriend and I stood in line for 30 minutes to have our bags stored for a couple of hours, only to have the gentleman tell us it was cash only. He points us to the atm. We withdraw the appropriate amount, but had to get at the back of the line, to wait another 20 minutes. The rooms were not dirty, but there was obvious signs that the rooms needed some physical maintenance. Windows were practically opaque with a weird white residue. Outlets were extremely loose, so phone chargers just simply fell out. The room was unbelievably small for the price. You could only set the temperature to 71 degrees Fahrenheit. Staff seemed uninterested in their guests. Again, the gym was closed. And there was a guest lounging area in the second floor that looked nice and peaceful. However, our key cards did not allow us access. Perhaps spending almost $800 for two nights did not qualify us to use these “exclusive” areas.","title: Subpar bang for your buck.

Mohammad,United Arab Emirates,Superior Room with 2 Twin Beds,1 night,Family,05-20-2023 00:00:00,horrible experience,2.0,en-us,"Nothing, but the location","My recent stay at the Paramount Hotel in New York Times Square was nothing short of a nightmare. From start to finish, the experience was marred by excessive charges, rude and disrespectful staff at the front desk, worn-down rooms, and an overall lack of cleanliness. I cannot express enough how disappointed I am with this hotel. First and foremost, it is absurd that the Paramount Hotel charges $2 for every bag. This is an unnecessary and unwelcome expense that no other hotel in New York City imposes. It's frustrating to see a hotel nickel and dime its guests, especially considering the already hefty price tag of a room in this area. The front desk staff displayed an appalling level of rudeness and disrespect. They seemed disinterested in providing any sort of assistance or addressing guests' concerns. Their lack of professionalism was evident in their dismissive attitudes and condescending remarks. I found it incredibly disheartening to be treated this way during my stay. The rooms themselves were worn down and in dire need of renovation. It was evident that the hotel had neglected proper maintenance. The furniture was dated, and the carpets were stained and threadbare. The walls showed signs of wear and tear, and the overall ambiance was far from welcoming. It was disheartening to see such a lack of care and attention to detail. Furthermore, cleanliness was a major issue throughout my stay. The housekeeping staff seemed to lack diligence in maintaining a hygienic environment. The bathroom was particularly disappointing, with moldy grout, dirty fixtures, and an unpleasant odor. It was evident that the cleaning standards were subpar, and it left me questioning the overall cleanliness of the entire hotel. Considering the Paramount Hotel's prime location in Times Square, one would expect a higher level of quality and service. Unfortunately, this was not the case.","title: horrible experience. liked: Nothing, but the location. disliked: My recent stay at the Paramount Hotel in New York Times Square was nothing short of a nightmare.

Not too comfortable. Shower stall itself has no light and was literally a hole in the wall. Felt like we were showering in a cave. Water took over five minutes to heat up and even then it was lukewarm water. If you are over 5’6” tall you will not be able to sit on the toilet without hitting your knees with the wall in front of you. Sink does not make sense.

When I went down to complain and ask for a different room the staff (including the manager) were rude and dismissive and didn’t actually seem to care. After a lot of back and forth they “upgraded” me to a much small room which once again was dirty. You’d think a 4 star hotel would be clean and the staff would be helpful… nope.

Our main goal is for all of our guest to explore the city, really soak up the Big Apple. Which is the reason why we do not have a lounge. There are plethora options of cafe and diners that offers coffee, etc, which is the reason why we do not have any of those amenities in the room. I want to inform you that we are schedule to go through a renovation at the beginning of 2023. I want to invite you back and give us another shot once we are done with renovation. Warm Regards, The Paramount NYC Team"

Altantsetseg,United States,Superior Room with Two Double Beds,2 nights,Group,11-02-2022 00:00:00,terrible service - staff don’t care,1.0,en-us,nothing,"Terrible customer service from the manager Jailene. She didn't address our problem at all and threatened to call cops on me and security. The security guy was super nice and tried to keep things cool but that manager lady, she left with her purse somewhere without even talking and addressing the situation. I called the booking and they tried calling and emailing the hotel, no one responded to them. The manager left with a grumpy face and being angry with me as a customer. For a four star hotel, you need to have a minimum quality to know how to deal with people. It's New York and you will meet people from different backgrounds and cultural differences.

Great location.,"Rooms are very small with hardly enough room to open a suitcase. No kettle, tea & coffee. Not even a cup or glass in the room to drink water from the tap with. Low water pressure from the shower. Inadequate windows mean constant noise from the street. There is no bar or cafe/restaurant, though the Sony bar is accessible and discounted for hotel guests. You would expect a hotel like this to at least have a lobby bar and I'm sure it did once but has been removed for some reason. No luggage assistance. Additional (albeit small) fees for holding baggage after check out are charged. The lobby is dark and unwelcoming with bad music and as mentioned, no bar or access to drinks or food there. They should be making the most of the historic charm of the building but have decided to make it bizarre instead - its a shame. Look at the Edison further along the street to see what could be done. Non-optional 'facility' charge (or something like that) - this seems to be increasingly common but that doesn't make it right, these are just disguised fees to make the headline rate look lower I assume.","title: Expensive hotel that only deserves 2/3 stars. liked: Rooms were kept very clean and were quite comfortable and the room cleaning staff were very friendly and helpful.

Elizabeth,United States,Superior Room with Two Double Beds,2 nights,Family,10-03-2022 00:00:00,Disappointing,4.0,en-us,The favorite part of my stay was breakfast at the lovely French cafe just a few doors down from the hotel. A great atmosphere with delicious food and beverages. Very authentic!! I will say the housekeeping staff were very pleasant and eager to assist.,"Overall, I found the hotel to be disappointing. I made the reservation at the last minute and selected it primarily for the price…I should have known the cheaper price would be reflected in the quality of the room. Our room was quite rundown and in desperate need of updating. The paint on the furniture was chipping all over. There wasn’t a table lamp on the nightstand. The only lighting for the room was a poorly lite overhead lamp. The carpet was dirty/stained with frayed edges coming up from the floor. I’m not usually one to worry about walking in hotel rooms barefoot, but I definitely was here. It would seem the hotel likes to market itself as a hip and trendy place to stay, but that doesn’t seem to go beyond the hotel lobby. My takeaway, this hotel is catering to people looking for an inexpensive place to stay and therefore can justify skimping on investing in hotel rooms that are welcoming, comfortable places for their guests.","title: Disappointing. liked: The favorite part of my stay was breakfast at the lovely French cafe just a few doors down from the hotel.

Unfortunately most of our rooms do not have a view as we are a short building, but we always do our best to accommodate views for guests when they are requested beforehand. It can be much harder to find a room with a view the same day, but I still offer my apologies. We take full payment at check in because we do not use the more common operating systems that function through authorization. However we are very willing to compensate and refund guests whenever issues are encountered. Please reach out to us to sort out some sort of compensation if you have not yet. Thank you"

Mikhail,United States,Single Room,2 nights,Solo traveller,09-17-2022 00:00:00,"2 night stay, 2 rooms with failed air-conditioner, broken promise of upgrade, and a strange elevator",4.0,en-us,Paramount is a hotel of contrasts. The check-in was nice and quick. The lobby is a bit pretentious but nice and spacious and is a big contrast to the rooms. The rooms are tiny and nothing special as you would expect at that price range in NY with about foot to foot and a half around the bed and 2-3 feet on the side of the door so the door could open. I have stayed in that area of NY many times and I feel the rooms are smaller at the Paramount.,"Window in the room was open and I could not close it. I called the room service and someone showed up very quickly and closed the window. Once the window was closed I realized that the air-conditioner does not work. I called room service again and an engineer showed up quickly and concluded that the air-conditioner does not work and said he would report it. After waiting for about 30 min, I called the guest service again and she said that she reported it to the manager already and connected me to the manager. The conversation with the manager lasted 5 seconds - he just briefly told me to go down to the reception and they would give me a new room. So I did. The receptions was taking her time to speak with two guests for at least 10 minutes. When it was my turn, she apologized for the room and said that she would give me an upgraded room. My new room was not an upgrade though. It was almost the same room with a smaller bathroom. It had a narrow shower and curtain so short that it could not stop water from flowing outside the shower and creating a paddle in the bathroom that had nowhere to go. In the morning, it was quite warm, I checked the air-conditioner and it did not work! To top it all off, the elevator in this hotel has a lot of character and does not always react as you would expect, not a big deal, but annoying.","title: 2 night stay, 2 rooms with failed air-conditioner, broken promise of upgrade, and a strange elevator. liked: Paramount is a hotel of contrasts.

Pretty sure prison cells are larger than the rooms provided. I booked a “deluxe king room” and was no where close to deluxe. Room was dirty, bed in the middle of the room with unmade sheets. Headboard had grease stains, carpet had stains, chair was dirty, plastic dresser was dirty. What you see online is not what you get. No decorative pillows, no bed throw blankets, no picture frames, NOTHING! Nothing about my deluxe King room was inviting. And don’t get me started on the bathroom! Where the outlet plugs are located throughout the rooms and bathroom makes absolutely no sense. I couldn’t even curl my hair because the cord didn’t reach the location of the mirror. Also, no type of microwave, refrigerator, tea maker, you know, the amenities that most hotels have in their rooms. Staying in times sq isn’t cheap! So the amount I paid for my stay at the Paramount I could’ve stayed somewhere else and got better amenities. I even called down to the front office one night to buy water because my mouth was dry and guess what, they don’t sell water/snacks/coffee, NOTHING!!!! I had to leave my hotel room at midnight and walk a block to a food truck to buy water. I’ve never stayed at a hotel that doesn’t at least have a vending machine in the lobby. Nothing at this hotel made sense!!! When I spoke to the manager Gabriella about the room she told me, “they don’t focus on their rooms but more so the amenities and lobby.

Die Möbel am Waschbecken sind völlig derangiert, von der Feuchtigkeit aufgequollen sodass der Waschbecken wellig und rostig wurde. Dreck, abgekratzte Türen, Bodenbeleg mit Flecken, klapprige Heizkörperverkleidung, im Aufzug der Boden kaputt, man hatte Angst da einzusteigen. Im Zimmer gab es ein unmögliches, erstickendes schimmeliges Gestank. Selbst die Putzkolonnen können hier nicht zaubern, das Hotel ist einfach renovierungsbedürftig. Das Zimmer war so klein, dass ich unfähig war, mein Koffer auf dem Boden hinzulegen und aufzumachen. Wenn man badete, war gleich das Fenster IM ZIMMER beschlagen (das sagt aus wie klein die Zimmer sind). Fenster liess sich nur auf eine kleine Spalte aufmachen, das Lüften war so gut wie unmöglich.

Era stata fatta una procedura in anticipo tramite una loro piattaforma per evitare di avere coda arrivati all'hotel e invece di coda ne ho fatta e anche parecchia. Avevo una serata a teatro prenotata e mi ero preparata con largo anticipo, ho perso più di 40 minuti in attesa di fare il check-in rischiando di perdere la mia serata, motivo principale che mi aveva portata a fare questo viaggio a NYC e anche questo era stato comunicato in anticipo, anche via email, in quanto non volevo ci fossero intoppi (e mi era stato confermato che non ce ne sarebbero stati e che il personale è molto veloce ed efficiente con questa procedura a maggior ragione se si effettuava l'anticipata tramite il portale/sito). La persona ha perso molto tempo a parlare e a scherzare con tutte le persone della fila rischiando di farmi perdere la serata; è stata esortata da più persone a sbrigarsi perchè di coda se ne formava continuamente e con poca possibilità di avanzare e la risposta che ci è stata data (a tutti, non solo a me), è stata molto scortese e maleducata. L'hotel dovrebbe prendere dei seri provvedimenti nei confronti di questa persona; ha messo tutti di cattivo umore e non ha fatto cominciare il mio soggiorno nel migliore dei modi. Alla fine non ho fatto il check-in, me ne sono andata dalla coda e ho messo le valige in deposito, il personale qui è davvero amorevole e disponibilissimo. Ho preferito godermi la serata a teatro - e se non avessi agito in questo modo l'avrei sicuramente persa - mi è stato detto di tornare a fare il check-in secondariamente (prima di mezzanotte, come da regola), e in questo caso tutto è andato benissimo.

I want to apologize for the negative experience you had during your stay. Unfortunately, street noises are unavoidable in middle of Times Square. But we have earplugs for guests who are not familiar to the city noise. I would also recommend to request a room facing north side, which is the back of the building. It helps to mitigate some of the excess noise. With that being said, we are constantly updating and changing to better our service and ultimately, better your experience. I hope to host you again when you are visiting NYC again. Warm Regards, The Paramount NYC Team"

Las llaves me dejaron de funcionar unas horas después de que me las dieran nuevas y tuve que hacer la fila del check in con una gran cantidad de gente adelante ya que en la recepción había solo una persona y cuando le dije que sólo debía resolver el problema de bloqueo de llave me dijo de mala manera que haga toda la fila de check In. Me pidieron una pre-autorización de mi tarjeta de crédito de 200 dólares, algo que es normal por si se rompe algo pero al hacer el check out pedí que retiraran el bloqueo y me dijeron que no porque ellos no habían revisado cómo yo había dejado la habitación y en vez de fijarse en ese momento y desbloquearme el monto en cuestión, me dijeron que esperara hasta el día siguiente a que ellos tuviesen tiempo de revisar mi habitación. Realmente una falta de respeto. Al momento nose aún si me lo van a desbloquear o no. Una pésima experiencia, no volvería ni lo recomendaría.","title: Pésima estadía. liked: El cuarto estaba limpio y ordenado. la ubicación es excelente. disliked: Me quedé solo una noche.
